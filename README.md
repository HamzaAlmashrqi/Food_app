# Food_app
Flutter Food Order Application Using Provider , GET_IT and Firebase Firestore.
The goal of this app is to build a fully functioning Food Order app using Flutter. The app depends mainly on Firebase Firestore as source of data and we work with Provider as our state managment and we used get_it as dependency injection. This app is a part of a series of youtube tutorial updated weekly to add new features to the app. Here is the link to my youtube channel if you are interested to see the app built step by step: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMWNUCyoCdQNnH7B_Qv_fFw .
