Flutter Food Order Application Using Provider , GET_IT and Firebase Firestore.
The goal of this app is to build a fully functioning Food Order app using Flutter. The app depends mainly on Firebase Firestore as source of data and we work with Provider as our state managment and we used get_it as dependency injection.
